Hello! I'm a passionate graduate student in Mathematics at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, where I specialize in numerical analysis of differential equations with stochastic data. As I prepare for my master's thesis, I'm excited to contribute to the field by exploring innovative approaches to complex mathematical challenges.

Mathematics has always been a beacon for me, drawing me in with its universal application across various fields. My studies have not only provided me with a deep understanding of mathematical concepts but also a clear vision of their potential impact on future technologies, particularly in AI research.

When I'm not immersed in equations, I enjoy expressing my creativity through photography and programming. I'm also a seasoned player of American football and a guitarist, with over ten years of experience in each. These hobbies provide a balance to my academic pursuits, allowing me to blend analytical rigor with artistic expression.

As I move forward in my career, I am eager to make a mark in the world, whether in the academic sphere or in industry.
